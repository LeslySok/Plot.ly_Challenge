# Belly Button Biodiversity

Welcome to my interactive dashboard. In this dashboard you can explore the [Belly Button Diversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that cononize human navels. 

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
